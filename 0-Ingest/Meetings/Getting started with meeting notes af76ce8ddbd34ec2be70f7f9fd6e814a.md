👋 This Meetings template helps you organize your meetings in Notion, such as setting agendas and taking notes.

You can use Notion pages to collaborate on meeting notes with your team, such as 1:1s, stand-ups, and team meetings. Each meeting can be stored in this database, to help your team stay organized. 

# How to use this template

1. This is your team’s meeting notes database. You can click on each item to open it up to its own page where you can add categorical information, create an agenda, and record action items — right alongside your teammates.
