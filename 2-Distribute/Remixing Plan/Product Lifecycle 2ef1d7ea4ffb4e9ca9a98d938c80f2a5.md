# 1. Create a roadmap item

Be sure to tag the item with the appropriate status, stakeholders, and dates. 

# 2. Create a product spec or a one-pager

There are a couple ways to link to other pages in your workspace:

- Type `/link` and press `enter` to create something like this:
    
    [OKRs](OKRs%20b080462f0c014b15b19098a6289ed91b.csv)
    
- Or link to a page inline by typing `@` followed by the page name, like so: ‣

# 3. Submit spec for review

Assign the roadmap item to the appropriate reviewer(s). Mark the spec `In Review` in the Docs database.

# 4. Notify stakeholders

Make sure you loop in the right stakeholders, including design and engineering. You can reference other guides in this wiki to figure out who these people are. The [](Mark%201%20Plan%20(draft)/Product%20b126dc138a0d4aa39257a4c9b1a2b45c.md) is a good place to start.
